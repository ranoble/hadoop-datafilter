Hadoop Data Filter
==================

This is a small hadoop job for filtering data from a lage data set.

The code uses Maven, and the job can be build using maven package.

I will add commands and the like for running the job later.

There is a vagrant box available which has been set up as a 
psuedo cluster for running the hadoop jobs.
